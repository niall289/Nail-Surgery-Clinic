🔁 Claude 4.0 Replit Agent Prompt – Full Project Rebrand to "The Nail Surgery Clinic"
You are a Claude 4.0 assistant inside a Replit project, assigned to rebrand and refactor an existing medical chatbot + portal system originally built for Footcare Clinic.

🎯 Objective:
Update every part of the project to reflect the new client:
✅ The Nail Surgery Clinic
🤖 Bot Name: Niamh
🌐 Website: https://www.nailsurgeryclinic.ie

This is a complete rebrand, not a partial update. All text, references, assets, and settings must reflect The Nail Surgery Clinic.

✅ Must Update:
🔤 Names & Branding
Replace all instances of Footcare Clinic or Footcare (case insensitive) with The Nail Surgery Clinic

Replace Fiona as bot name with Niamh throughout UI, code comments, display text, and variables

Replace all footer/header brand mentions, titles, and descriptions

Update primary color theme to match brand identity of [nailsurgeryclinic.ie] (e.g. soft pink, white, neutral medical tones — use judgement)

Swap favicon/logo references (if hardcoded or linked)

📁 File Names & Project Structure
Rename any files or folders using footcare, e.g.:

chatbot-footcare-client1 ➜ chatbot-nailsurgery-client1

FootCarePortal-1 ➜ NailSurgeryPortal-1

Update internal import paths to reflect renamed folders/files

🧠 Settings & Tone
Welcome message:
"Hi, I’m Niamh, your assistant at The Nail Surgery Clinic. How can I help with your nail care today?"

Tone: "Professional and caring"

CTA button: "Ask Niamh"

🏥 Clinics & Contact Info
Update locations, opening hours, and clinic contact details using scraped or manually inserted info from https://www.nailsurgeryclinic.ie

🔗 Webhook
Update the consultation webhook URL:
https://nailsurgeryclinicadmin.engageiobots.com/api/webhook/consultation

🖼️ Image & AI Analysis
Keep AI image analysis functionality, but adjust prompt tone to refer to nail conditions (e.g. “redness,” “fungus,” “ingrown nail”) not foot pain

Update default sample images or placeholder text (if any)

⚙️ Schema & Functionality (DO NOT TOUCH)
❌ Do not alter shared/schema.ts — keep field names as-is

✅ Ensure consultation form still sends:

name, email, phone, issue_category, symptom_description, image_analysis, etc.

✅ Keep CSV export, message sending, and follow-up features fully intact

🧪 QA Checklist After Update:
 Chatbot now shows Niamh and Nail Surgery brand

 Portal shows The Nail Surgery Clinic across all pages

 Webhook POSTs go to new endpoint and succeed

 All field mappings are intact (no nulls on submit)

 Brand visuals, colors, and naming are consistent throughout

📦 Bonus (Optional):
If dynamic settings from /api/chatbot-settings are supported, update portal values to reflect the new clinic's:

welcome message

bot name (Niamh)

tone

button label

color theme

Treat this as a white-label cloning operation. Your job is to turn this into a new branded product without changing any of the core working parts. Same functionality — completely new identity.
