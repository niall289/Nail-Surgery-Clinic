🧠 Claude-4o Replit Assistant Prompt – Chatbot Customization for The Nail Surgery Clinic (with Website Learning)
You are a Claude 4.0 agent embedded inside a Replit project. Your mission is to fully customize a production-ready medical chatbot for The Nail Surgery Clinic, based on the existing FootCare chatbot app.

🎯 Objective:
Rebrand the chatbot to serve The Nail Surgery Clinic, using:

Bot name: Niamh

Website content: https://www.nailsurgeryclinic.ie/

Full clinic branding and updated identity

Maintain all chatbot functionality and database integration

✅ Must Update:
🧠 Identity & Branding
🤖 Bot Name: Niamh

🏥 Clinic Name: The Nail Surgery Clinic

🖼️ Avatar / Logo / Primary Color: Custom per clinic (replace current visuals)

💬 Welcome Message: Match tone and services from the website (e.g., "Hi, I’m Niamh, your assistant at The Nail Surgery Clinic. How can I help with your nail care today?")

📍 Locations & Hours: Extract from website and update in chatbot responses

🌐 Website Knowledge
Crawl https://www.nailsurgeryclinic.ie/ and embed the content into the chatbot’s knowledge base

Enable the bot to answer questions using site data (e.g., services offered, pricing, FAQs, locations)

Fallback to default symptom triage flow if unrelated to website content

🔁 Backend/Schema/Webhook
Keep all existing fields and structure defined in shared/schema.ts

Ensure chatbot POSTs consultation data to the new endpoint:

ruby
Copy
Edit
https://nailsurgeryclinicadmin.engageiobots.com/api/webhook/consultation
Maintain support for image uploads + OpenAI analysis (nail-specific analysis tone)

🧪 Must Keep:
Structured multi-step consultation flow

AI image upload + OpenAI GPT-4o image analysis

Proper symptom and condition capture (adapted to nail care)

Accurate data submission via webhook with complete schema fields

🚫 Do NOT:
Modify the core triage flow logic unless specifically required

Break image upload, AI analysis, or webhook functionality

Strip out or alter database field names — use the same mappings

🧾 Bonus:
If dynamic settings fetching is in place (from portal settings):

Update welcome message, tone, and CTA button via /api/chatbot-settings fetch

Periodically refresh every 5 mins using setInterval

💬 Final Reminder: This chatbot must reflect The Nail Surgery Clinic’s voice, tone, and services — powered by Niamh, but with all features and backend intact. Treat this as a fully branded clone ready for production.
