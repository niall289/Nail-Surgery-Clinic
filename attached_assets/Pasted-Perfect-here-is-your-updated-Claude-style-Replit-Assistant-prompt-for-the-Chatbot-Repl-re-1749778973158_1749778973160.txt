Perfect ‚Äî here is your **updated Claude-style Replit Assistant prompt** for the **Chatbot Repl**, revised to:

* üí¨ **Ask the assistant to evaluate** whether adding camelCase field variants would solve the issue
* ‚úÖ **List exactly which fields to consider**
* üö´ **Prevent it from making any changes** until we review and approve
* üë®‚Äçüî¨ Encourage careful analysis without assumption or premature edits

## üß† CHATBOT PROMPT ‚Äî FIELD NAME MAPPING EVALUATION (NO CHANGES YET)

> üéØ **Paste this into the Replit Assistant inside the Chatbot Repl**

---

You are a Claude 4.0 agent embedded in a **medical chatbot project**. The chatbot currently sends a consultation payload to the portal at `/api/webhook/consultation`.

‚úÖ The webhook returns a success message
‚ùå But many key fields still appear as `null` in the admin portal

We‚Äôve confirmed that the portal webhook supports **multiple field name variants** (e.g. `issueSpecifics` or `issue_specifics`) and may only be populating values when it receives specific camelCase field names.

---

### üéØ Objective (For Evaluation Only):

Review the current webhook payload and consider **whether adding camelCase variants** of the key fields would solve the issue ‚Äî **without changing anything yet**.

---

### üß™ Fields to Evaluate for Mapping:

Determine if it would help to send these **in addition to** (not instead of) the existing snake\_case fields:

| Variant to Consider  | Current field         |
| -------------------- | --------------------- |
| `issueSpecifics`     | `issue_specifics`     |
| `symptomDescription` | `symptom_description` |
| `previousTreatment`  | `previous_treatment`  |
| `imageAnalysis`      | `image_analysis`      |
| `calendarBooking`    | `calendar_booking`    |
| `finalQuestion`      | `final_question`      |
| `additionalHelp`     | `additional_help`     |
| `emojiSurvey`        | `emoji_survey`        |
| `surveyResponse`     | `survey_response`     |

> The portal may map these automatically if present in the payload.

---

### üß† What You Should Do:

* Review the current final `payload` object in `use-chat.ts`
* Think critically: Would **adding these camelCase fields** alongside the existing snake\_case ones help with compatibility?
* Output your reasoning, with an example of what the **final payload structure could look like** if we added both versions

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT:

* Make any code changes yet
* Rename state variables or modify chatbot flow
* Remove existing snake\_case fields
* Send an updated payload

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Stack:

* React + TypeScript (Vite)
* Express backend
* Sends final POST to `/api/webhook/consultation`

Wait for explicit approval before making any edits. Your job right now is to **evaluate, explain, and propose ‚Äî not execute**.
